							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> When choosing a font, the most important principles to keep in mind are readability, legibility, and purpose. 
								In addition, as to not overwhelm the reader, limit font pairing to no more than three fonts. The fonts themselves, not only their sizes, also guide
								the reader into categories and hierarchy. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article were all the different hyperlinked resources that help you
								with different aspects of typography such as determining font pairs, gaining inspiration from actual websites, and determining
								what font you are looking at. It's really cool that CSS somehow knows so many fonts and I wonder about the 
								process of creating a font and somehow putting it into CSS's database of fonts so that others can use it too. I also liked the part 
								of the article that talked about knowing your audience when choosing fonts, such as if they are children or the elderly, because 
								certain fonts work better for their readability. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When learning to read, children need highly legible fonts with generous letter shapes... 
								Other fonts are more appropriate for seniors. Senior-friendly fonts use readable sizes, high contrasting colors, and avoid scripts and decorative styles.""
