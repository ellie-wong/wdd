            Hi! My name is Ellie and I'm from Palo Alto, California. I'm 19 years old and the youngest of three sisters! :D 
            When I'm not rotting in bed, falling down YouTube rabbit holes, or working on my annual reading goal, I enjoy
            hiking in national parks, making elaborate Instant Pot/air fryer creations, and playing board games with friends.

            Some of my favorite places to grab a bite in Berkeley:

          </ul>

            <li>There are so many design decisions that go into every app or website we view that we take for granted! 
                Before this article, I never really considered how an app like Twitter might make decisions to change the length/detail of a timestamp
                based on which view one is looking at.
            </li>
            <li>My favorite part of this article were the GIFs deconstructing the design components of app pages. 
                Clearly, the inclusion of these were a design choice in itself which allows the reader's eyes to be drawn to each individual 
             element and how it fits into the app's design as a whole.
            </li>
            <li>"Who are the people using this product? How might their use cases be different from yours? How does the design serve these use cases?"
            </li>
            <li>
                I would rate this a 8/10 for its ease of read.
