                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> By seeing all these examples of animation in UI design, I was able to get a sense of what 
                                movement on a website can add to the user perception. It definitely gives the website or app 
                                a sense of being more high-end and technologically-advanced and keeps the reader's eye interested. The graphics that are 
                                advertising apps and demonstrating how one might interact with them on their own smartphones are especially clever as 
                                a marketing tool. 
                             </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I liked how such a broad variety of different UI designs were provided, from app advertisements to 
                                magazine or portfolio sites to website home pages. I was able to notice how different interfaces 
                                serve different purposes and highlight certain aspects of whatever is being marketed. Interactive UI designs really
                                add to the experience of the viewer and catch my attention.
                             </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked the Shazam style shopping idea UI animation, which was showed the viewer exactly
                                how the app can be used to identify clothing and find where to buy it. It really made the app look smooth
                                and visually appealing and definitely made me want to try it out. All of the movements or transitions are seamless
                                and easily flow into each other, creating a clean look that is so satisfying. If I saw
                                this animation on an advertisement, the smooth interface would give it a sense of legitimacy and 
                                make me believe it is not a scam and that perhaps I should explore this app. </p>
