						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that symmetry is an important Gestalt principle that can apply to website design. However, explicit symmetry
								can become boring for the reader, and thus symmtery with asymmetrical elements is often the way to go because it keeps 
							the reader engaged while also grouping relevant elements together in their mind. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the visuals that went along with the article's main points. They reminded me a lot of the game of Set, which I 
								played a lot over spring break, and is definitely a practice of using Gestalt principles in reality by grouping items together in our minds, even if we may
							not realize it. Specifically, I enjoyed the outlines of entire webpages with elements and colors suggesting which were meant to be grouped together.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Symmetrical elements are simple, harmonious and visually pleasing. Our eyes seek those attributes along with order and stability, to make sense of the world. For this reason, Symmetry is a useful tool for communicating information quickly and efficiently. Symmetry feels comfortable helping us focus on what's important."
