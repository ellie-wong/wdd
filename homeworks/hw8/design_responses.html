					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that there are a lot of sinister and malicious intentions that can contribute to website design and these can have grave legal and societal implications. 
							To be honest, I had not really considered these tricky tactics that all these sites implement to try to
						get something out of us because I have just grown up being accustomed to them, and thus being able to sense these dark patterns 
					decently well. But for older people like my grandma, they are extremely gullible to these dark patterns and I find it shocking and alarming the ease at which
				others will jump to take advantage of those with less experience using the internet.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I liked all the examples of the different dark patterns as well as the images of real-world examples that illustrated them. I tend 
							to not even notice these dark patterns anymore since they're just so common. I think that using a pop-up blocker or adBlocker extension can help
							for sure with falling victim to these dark patterns.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Good user experience design is about providing the users with seamless, enjoyable interactions with products. It has the user's best interest in mind, and is not deceptive or sneaky in nature." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>

						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
