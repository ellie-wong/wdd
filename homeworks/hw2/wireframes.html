					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <img src="assets/imgs/Goodreads Wireframe-1.jpg" /> </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> <img src="assets/imgs/Goodreads Wireframe-2.jpg" /> </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> Goodreads is a social media website for people who love books. It is used by readers and authors alike to track, rate, review, and recommend 
								books. It also allows authors to communicate directly with their fans, often answering questions about their writing process
								or hosting giveaway lotteries. The design allows for users to create their own virtual sorted "bookshelves" for others to see-- these include books marked as 
							"want to read", "currently reading", and "read", but the user can also add more custom bookshelves, for example books sorted by genre or for a specific class project. Goodreads also has 
						its own recommendation algorithm based on genres a reader enjoys or books that "similar readers" have rated highly. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>

							<p> Goodreads' website design is extremeley outdated and this is a sentiment broadly shared by 
								its users. The homepage is redundant and cluttered, with the center of focus being an advertisement 
								for an upcoming release the user may or may not be interested in. In addition, the same featured blog post that Goodreads wishes
								you to read is advertised in three different places on the homepage: on the very top, in the middle, and in the right column.
								This is a redundant waste of space-- especially if a given user is not interested. </p>
								
							<p>Thus, to address some of these issues, in my redesiged wireframe of the Goodreads homepage I
								 included the featured post only once, in a carousel at the focus of the page, 
								which would also contain a list of trending books on the site and other articles/lists of interest. 
								I also included a column
								on the left which contains an activity log for a user and their friends, which would be expandable if clicked
								or hovered upon. There is really no reason to make the updates feed the main content of the website, especially if, say, 
								one uses Goodreads to mainly keep track of their own reading. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
