							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								I learned that users would rather scroll and scroll some more for a mobile or webpage design with 
								proper whitespace between elements rather than viewing all the content cluttered together 
								without having to scroll.

								I also learned that Wayfair does spacing in widths of multiples of 8 pixels because
								it helps create a uniform sense of consistency. Moreover, despite the common 
								belief that whitespace is wasted space, it actually helps to improve readability and draw 
								focus to the most important part of the page.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article were the screenshots of how whitespace is 
								actually incorporated into different parts of Wayfair's mobile and browser design, and on 
								different pages that maybe have different goals. For instance, the home page takes on a 
								minmalist aspect, using whitespace to maintain focus and direct the user's attention
								to entering their account singup info. But on another page, where lots of different products,
								with many distracting colors and patterns, are shown, whitespace is used to enforce grouping/categorization 
								and as buffers as to not visually overwhelm the viewer.

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Users have evolved and become more comfortable with scrolling. There are definitely certain elements that are best suited above the fold, but it's important not to limit the use of white space to accommodate for the fold.
								" </p>

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
