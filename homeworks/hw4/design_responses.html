					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there are legal standards for ensuring website accessibility and that many lawsuits
								have been filed on the issue of color accessibility. Though I don't experience vision or color impairment myself, 
								it seems reasonable that government websites in particular abide by accessibility standards so that all citizens
								who want to can read their content.
							 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the section about adding texture to graphs or charts to help
								colorblind people differentiate between, for instance, bars in a bar graph. I had not thought 
								about this before but it seems very important to ensuring that data is not misinterpreted. I will definitely keep this 
							in mind the next time I make visualizations that can potentially be seen by many.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude."" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
