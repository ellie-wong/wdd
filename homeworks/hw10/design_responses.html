							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I had not really thought about different types of human attention before but I had learned
								about the cocktail party effect in my high school AP Psych class. I think cognitive overload or having too many options is definitely something I have struggled with. I get overwhelmed and eventually end up wasting a lot of time and eventually choosing no option. 
								One example of this is when I'm browsing Netflix trying to find a movie or TV show to watch before bed. There are too many options and I spend so long researching all of them that I eventually get tired and don't watch anything. One example of selective attention is when I 
								read books while listening to music with words. I have to choose to give my main attention to the words on the page instead of the ones in my head.
